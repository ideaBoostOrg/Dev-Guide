####Writing Proper Commit Messages - A Developer's Guide
Writing clear and descriptive commit messages is essential for maintaining a well-documented and organized codebase. Follow these guidelines to ensure your commit messages are effective and meaningful:

**1. Start with a Capital Letter**
Begin the commit message with a capital letter for clarity and consistency.

**2. Use the Imperative Mood**
Write commit messages in the imperative mood, which means using command-like language. For example, use "Fix bug" instead of "Fixed bug" or "Fixes bug."

**3. Keep it Short and Precise**
Keep the commit message concise and to the point. Ideally, it should fit within 50 characters. If you need to provide more details, use the next guideline.

**4. Separate Subject from Body**
If necessary, separate the subject from the body of the commit message with a blank line. The subject should be a short summary, and the body can provide additional context or details.

**5. Use Emojis (Optional)**
Consider using emojis at the beginning of the commit message to indicate the type of change. Here are some common ones:

- ‚ú® Feat: New feature
- üêõ Fix: Bug fixes
- üìö Docs: Documentation changes
- üé® Style: Style or formatting changes
- ‚ö° Perf: Improvements to code performance
- ‚úÖ Test: Adding or updating tests

**6. Reference the Issue**
If your code changes are related to an issue or ticket in your project's issue tracker (e.g., GitHub Issues), include a reference to it. For example: "Fix bug in login process (#123)."

**7. Use Present Tense**
Write commit messages in the present tense, describing what the commit does, not what it did. For example, "Add new feature" instead of "Added new feature."

**8. Use the Appropriate Type**
Choose the appropriate commit type from the following list to categorize your changes:

- Feat: Feature Addition
- Fix: Bug Fixes
- Docs: Documentation Changes
- Style: Style or Formatting Changes
- Perf: Code Performance Improvements

#####Examples:
**Feature Addition:**

    Feat: Implement user authentication

**Bug Fix:**

    Fix: Resolve issue with login form validation

**Documentation Update:**

    Docs: Update README with usage instructions

**Style Change:**

    Style: Format code according to style guidelines
    
    Made changes to indentations and removed unused imports.

**Performance Improvement:**

    Perf: Optimize database query for faster response

**Test Addition:**

    Test: Add unit tests for the login feature

**Reference the Issue:**

    Fix: Bug in login process (#123)

**Use Present Tense:**

    Test: Add unit tests for the login feature

Remember, writing clear and descriptive commit messages not only helps you and your team to understand the changes better but also contributes to the maintainability and collaboration within the project.
